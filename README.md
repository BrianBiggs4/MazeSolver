# Maze Solver ðŸ§©

This project is a **maze solver** that demonstrates how different pathfinding algorithmsâ€”**Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, and **A\*** â€” perform in solving the same maze. The goal is not only to solve the maze, but also to **visually show the efficiency and behavior** of each algorithm.

I created this project to **solidify my understanding of search algorithms** and how they apply to real-world problems like pathfinding. It's also a fun way to explore and visualize key computer science concepts in action.

This project was inspired and guided by concepts from the book  
**"Classic Computer Science Problems in Python"** by David Kopec.  
It helped shape my understanding of DFS, BFS, and A* search algorithms.
